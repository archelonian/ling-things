immediate
- only the most recent partition sticks for some reason
- clear what was most recently added to acc on failure?
  - intermediate variable

next
- file I/O rather than hard-coded dummy lists

future
- take word input rather than just {C, V}*
  - not actually sure if this will be useful to anyone though
- adapt for web app
- indicate at which point in the word the partitioning becomes impossible
