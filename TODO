now
- check more edge cases
  - duplicate syllables cause duplicate partitions
- weighting (favorability per se)

later
- indicate at which point in the word the partitioning becomes impossible
- directional (from front, from back) preference
  - preference specifically, since ordering is no matter because the recursive
    nature of the program gets all of them anyway
- generic string partitioner, separate syllabifier that has-a (or is-a?)
  partitioner but uses that partitioner specifically for syllable-related work
- improve data structure choices

future
- take word input rather than just {C, V}*
  - variability based on types of sounds precisely (ex. english "mister")
- adapt for web app
