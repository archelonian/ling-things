immediate
- fix recursive cases (related to refactor?)

next
- consider refactoring code to take "base" out entirely
  - most of the recursion is dependent on the prefixSize, base actually hardly
    comes into play
  - actually, there's no need to pass a prefixSize in either, since the
    algorithm just iteratively checks the first 1 up to n characters
  - checkSyll(String word, String acc)
- file I/O rather than hard-coded dummy lists

future
- take word input rather than just {C, V}*
  - not actually sure if this will be useful to anyone though
- adapt for web app
